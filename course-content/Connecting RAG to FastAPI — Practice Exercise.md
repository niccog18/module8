# Connecting RAG to FastAPI — Practice Exercise

## RAG API with Health Checks

**Objective:** Build a FastAPI RAG API with production-ready features: health checks, configurable parameters, and proper error handling.

**Time:** 35 minutes

**What you’ll do:**

1. Build `my_rag_api.py` with these endpoints:
    - `POST /ask` — Accept a question, return a grounded answer with sources and confidence
    - `POST /ingest` — Load documents from the `docs/` folder into ChromaDB
    - `GET /stats` — Return document count and model info
    - `GET /health` — Check if ChromaDB is accessible and Ollama is running
2. Include Pydantic schemas for all request/response models
3. Add CORS middleware for frontend connectivity
4. Handle these error cases:
    - Ollama not running → 503 Service Unavailable
    - No documents ingested → clear message in /ask response
    - Invalid question (empty string) → 422 validation error via Pydantic
5. Test all endpoints using Swagger UI at `/docs`

**Deliverable:** A working FastAPI RAG API that you can test in Swagger UI. All 4 endpoints functional, with proper error handling.

**Why this exercise?** This API is the backend for your module project. Getting it working and tested now means Week 2 focuses on Docker, not debugging the API.
